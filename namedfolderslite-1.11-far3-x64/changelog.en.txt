|   Named Folders Lite v1.11          (c) 2014+ Pepak, https://www.pepak.net   |
|______________________________________________________________________________|


  [!] Major change
  [+] Feature added
  [-] Bug fixed
  [*] Minor change

_______________________________________________________________________________

v1.11

  [+] Added support for opening the plugin's panel from the plugins menu
      (F11).

  [-] Fixed incorrect drawing of the plugin's dialogs in FAR versions 5788
      and newer.

  [*] Support building with Delphi 10.4 Sydney.

  [*] Cleaned up the source code.

_______________________________________________________________________________

v1.10

  [!] Rewritten the plugin to the new framework for FAR plugins. This will
      enable far easier maintenance in the future.

  [*] In the panel, changed the hotkey for opening of a named folder in the
      inactive panel from ALT+ENTER to SHIFT+ENTER. The latter combination
      works in FAR2, too.

  [*] Minor fixes for compatibility with Delphi 10.1 and newer.

  [-] Fixed incorrect displaying of the confirmation dialogs.

_______________________________________________________________________________

v1.04

  [+] Support for "cd:-": Every time a current folder is changed using this
      plugin (i.e. by "cd:xxx" or by pressing ENTER in the plugin's panel),
      the previous location gets saved to a memory variable. "cd:-" will then
      return to this saved location. The save is done even with "cd:-" itself,
      meaning that by repeating "cd:-", it is possible to switch back and
      forth between two locations.

  [+] Support for exporting and importing whole directories of bookmarks.
      When exporting a directory, a directory tree containing a set of XML
      files for each individual non-directory bookmark will be created.
      When importing a directory, all subdirectories will be scanned for
      XML files in the right format, and any found will be imported to the
      right bookmark directory.

  [-] Named Folders could not open a bookmark to itself, e.g. by opening
      a Named Folders panel, navigating to a directory, saving the location
      with "cd::nf", switching to "C:\" and then performing "cd:nf".

      Note that the same problem still applies to some third-party plugins,
      e.g. NetBox, because the cause lies primarily in the destination 
      plugin (or possibly FAR Manager itself).

  [-] If a bookmark "x" existed when using "cd::x" command, it would get
      completely replaced with new data. Now the Description will be copied
      to the new bookmark.

_______________________________________________________________________________

v1.03

  [+] Support for directly entering a subdirectory of a named folder with
      "cd:a/b\c\d". Here "a/b" is the name of the named folder and "\c\d" is
      a subdirectory to go to, determined as everything starting from the
      first backslash ("\"). E.g., assume that "a/b" points to "C:\WINDOWS".
      Then "cd:a/b\system32" opens "C:\WINDOWS\System32".
      This feature is disabled by default. If you want to use it, go to the
      plugin's options and activate the "Allow path suffix" option.

  [+] Support for paths starting with "\\", such as "\\server\share" or
      "\\.\pipe". For some reason, FAR will happily accept these paths on
      command line with a "CD \\path" command, but refuses to set panel
      directory to them - so I had to write an ugly hack which simulates a
      macro. For this reason, the support is rather shaky and requires that
      the command line be empty.

  [+] Optional support for plugin-based directories. Generally, with plugins
      you want to use the already existing functionality of linking directly
      to the plugin's panel (using Plugin ID, parameter and host file), but
      in some cases it may be better to use a plugin-starting command line.
      In that case, you can create a named folder without a link to plugin
      and provide a command line for directory: "edit:<for /?". This allows
      you to create shortcuts to non-panel functionality of a plugin.
      This feature is disabled by default. If you want to use it, go to the
      plugin's options and activate the "Allow plugin calls" option.
      Be wary of creating loops as these are not being detected and will
      eventually crash FAR Manager.

  [+] Enhanced the Plugin.Call("...", "OPEN") function to allow jumping to
      a specified named folder.  Simply add the named folder to the end
      of the path. Example: Plugin.Call("...", "OPEN", "sys/win"), where
      "sys" is a directory of named folders and "win" is a named folder.

  [+] Fuzzy search for a named folder ("cd:a" where you have no "a" named
      folder, but perhaps have "a123") is now optional and can be set in
      plugin's options. Default value is enabled, consistent with plugin's
      behavior so far.

  [+] Search for a named folder can now ignore directories. That is, "cd:a"
      will now also find "b\a" or even "b\a123" (with the standard fuzzy
      search). This feature is disabled by default but can be enabled in the
      options.

  [+] Added Ukrainian translation.

  [+] Added a selection of samples (by q726xan5on) which demonstrates the
      use of some of the more advanced features of Named Folders Lite,
      particularly this version's support for plugin-based directories.

  [+] Added English help file.

  [-] When editing an item from the panel without changing its name, the item
      got deleted.

  [-] Fixed a bug where creating a new named folder from the panel and
      giving it an already-existing name could lead to the old value being
      overwritten regardless of the answer to the confirmation dialog (more
      specifically, answering "No" would overwrite the value and then reopen
      the new/edit dialog).

_______________________________________________________________________________

v1.02

  [ ] FAR Forum user q726xan5on provided a number of ideas (and example
      code) for enhancing Named Folders Lite. Thanks!

  [+] Added Russian translation.

  [+] Command "cd:" opens the plugin's panel.

  [+] Support for remembering the last used directory in the plugin's panel.
      Note that this feature is turned off by default; if you want to use it,
      enable it in Plugin Options.

  [+] Support for using "variables" within directory-based named folders.
      The support is disabled by default, but can be enabled in Plugin
      Options globally and then for each kind of variable separately:

      - Known folders:   "$(DIR:STARTMENU)", "$(CSIDL_STARTMENU)"
        - Known Windows folders, as per Microsoft CSIDL constants:
          https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb762494(v=vs.85).aspx
      - Environment:     "$(ENV:USERPROFILE)", "$(ENV:TEMP)"
        - Environment variables of the current process.
      - CMD environment: "%USERPROFILE%", "%TEMP%"
        - Same as above, but with a different syntax (like in CMD.EXE).
      - Registry:        "$(REG:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\SomeApp)"
        - The last element is the name of the value to be used.
        - Note: Only string values are supported.

      You need to enter these variables by hand in a named folder's definition.
      There is no support for determining a variable name from the directory.

  [+] Support for Plugin.Call functionality of FAR's macro language. Read the
      details in the documentation.

  [-] Fixed an endless loop in case the users attempts to jump to a directory
      which doesn't have any existing component (e.g. target is "D:\A\B" but
      there is no "D:" drive present).

  [-] When creating new named folders from command line using "cd::name",
      create all intermediate directories. Before, "cd::a\b" correctly created
      a named folder, but unless directory "a" was created manually from the
      panels, "a\b" would not be visible (though you could still use it with
      "cd:a\b").

  [-] Fixed overflowing edit in the Make Directory dialog.

  [*] Support for building Named Folders Lite with Delphi 10.1 Berlin.

_______________________________________________________________________________

v1.01

  [!] When attempting to jump to a stored directory (cd:x), if that directory
      does not exist, you are offered to jump to the nearest existing parent
      directory instead.

  [!] Support for subdirectories in the names: You can now use names such as
      "a\b\c" (or "a/b/c") to better organize your bookmarks, though it is
      only really usable in the panels.

_______________________________________________________________________________

v1.00

  [!] The plugin is now published on FAR PlugRing.

_______________________________________________________________________________

v0.02

  [-] The plugin no longer appears when F11 is pressed in a dialog.

_______________________________________________________________________________

v0.01

  [!] Initial release. Currently a very tiny subset of the original Named
      Folder's functionality is supported.
