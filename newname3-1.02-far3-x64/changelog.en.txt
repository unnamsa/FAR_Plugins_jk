  [!] Major change
  [+] Feature added
  [-] Bug fixed
  [*] Minor change

_______________________________________________________________________________

v1.02

  [+] Support for renaming files from a temporary panel (the TMPPANEL plugin).

  [+] By default the plugin no longer creates "incompatible" filenames
      ending with a dot (e.g. with a template such as "%#.%e" if the
      source file has no extension). The old behavior can be enabled in
      the plugin's options, but is not recommended as many applications
      do not work with these filenames.

v1.01


  [!] Rewritten the plugin to the new plugin framework.

  [+] If the plugin is called with no selected files, the active file (the
      one under the cursor) can be used for renaming. This functionality
      must be enabled in the plugin's configuration first.

  [+] Added support for saving the counter value for each filename pattern
      separately. If enabled by the checkbox available in the NewName dialog,
      the saved value will be restored when you enter the same filename
      pattern later.

      Note that the search for saved patterns is case-sensitive.

  [-] Fixed a bug that increased the counter even when a rename failed.
      That would have caused skipped values in the renamed sequence.

  [*] Removed the "No 'odd' zeros" option because it is not really needed -
      in order to remove the leading zeroes, simply remove them from the
      number.

  [*] Optimized the processing of options: They are now only open for a
      limited time, allowing for a better concurrent execution of the plugin
      in multiple FAR windows. The options are only saved if their contents
      changed, preventing unnecessary modifications to the plugin's config
      file.

  [*] Cleaned up the source code.

_______________________________________________________________________________

v1.00

  [!] The plugin is now published on FAR PlugRing. In order to make this
      possible, the name was changed to "NewName3" to differentiate the
      plugin from the original "NewName" made by Ivan Sintyurin.

v0.01

  [!] First public version.
